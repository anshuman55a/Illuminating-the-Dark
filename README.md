# Illuminating the Dark: Low-Light Image Enhancement via Zero-Reference Deep Curve Estimation

The project aims to improve the quality of low-light images, making them clearer, brighter, 
and more detailed. The primary objective of this project can be broken down into the 
following sub-objectives:

* Implementation of Zero-DCE: Implement the Zero-Reference Deep Curve Estimation 
(Zero-DCE) method for enhancing low-light images.
* Address Visibility Issues: Address the problem of poor visibility and loss of detail in 
images captured in low-light conditions. This is particularly relevant to vision-based 
automatic driving assistance and transportation systems.
* Improve Image Quality: Improve the quality of low-light images, making them clearer, 
brighter, and more detailed. This involves leveraging the power of a lightweight deep 
network, DCE-Net, to estimate pixel-wise and high-order curves for dynamic range 
adjustment of a given image.
* Explore Potential Benefits: Explore the potential benefits of this method for 
applications such as face detection in the dark.
* Contribute to Field Advancements: Contribute to the ongoing advancements in the 
field of image processing and computer vision through the successful implementation 
and evaluation of the Zero-DCE method
